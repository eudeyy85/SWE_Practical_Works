# What you implemented:

# Exercise 1 [Modify the iterative function to return a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n, instead of just the nth number.]
In this exercise I implemented the function to generate Fibonacci sequences from 20 to 25 upto specified length.It starts a list with the first two terms and alliteratively calculates the next term by adding the previous two terms and then it returns the funtion to the the first n terms of the sequence.

# Exercise 2 [Implement a function that finds the index of the first Fibonacci number that exceeds a given value.]
In this exercise I implemented funtion to calculate the index of the first Fibonacci number that go beyound the given value. It alliteratively claculates the next number which starts with 10th and 11th fibonacci number(5 & 10) and the function returns the index when the calculated fibonacci number exceeds thegiven value.

# Exercise 3 [Create a function that determines if a given number is a Fibonacci number.]
In this exercise I implemented the function to determine whether a given number is a Fibonacci number.Used the function that a number n is a Fibonacci number if and only if either 5n^2+4 or 5n^2-4 is a perfect square and then calculates the values and checks if they are perfect squares using a helper function is_perfect_square.

# Exercise 4[Implement a function that calculates the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers and observe how it approaches the golden ratio.]
In this exercise I implemented the function to calculates the ratio of consecutive fibonacci numbers upto n term,it starts a list with the first 1 fibonacci numbers(0 & 2) and alliteratively calculates the next terms,then calculates the ratios of consecutive terms and stores them in a list.Lastly, it prints out the calculated ratios with the index of the Fibonacci numbers.
